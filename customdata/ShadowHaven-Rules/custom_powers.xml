        As a Free Action, make a Magic + (Power Rating) Test. For (Magic) Combat Turns, the adept adds their hits on the test to all Sprinting tests as successes regardless of the movement skill used (Swimming, Running, Flight). Physical Limit for Sprinting Tests is increased by the Rating of this power. After the power expires, resist Drain equal to twice the power’s Rating.

        Body Sculpt can now be used to mimic any metahuman metatype or metavariant, causing the adept to swell or shrink in accordance to the metatype being mimicked. This does not alter the adept’s attributes or give them additional abilities; dermal plating and horns given by imitating a troll are purely aesthetic and are not durable enough to be used as weapons. Metasapients like pixies or centaurs cannot be imitated. The adept must resist Stun Drain equal to the difference in base Body score between original and target metavariant.

        By spending a Free Action to utilize this metamagic technique, the adept can run seemingly on thin air without falling. The maximum distance they can run in mid-air is equal to their Initiate Grade in meters. If the adept ends their movement in the air, they immediately begin falling and cannot use Windwalk until they find a solid foothold again. By stressing their ability, the adept can extend this distance further. For every meter they choose to run beyond the safe distance, they must resist 1 point of Drain per meter. If the Drain exceeds their Magic Attribute, the Drain becomes Physical. When the adept can rest their weight on a real, physical load-bearing surface, the distance they can run resets. Using Windwalk leaves behind an astral signature.

        An adept with this enhancement finds his weapons quieter and harder to detect. Attempts to detect the sound of silent/suppressed weapons held by the adept suffer a dice pool penalty equal to the adept’s Initiate Grade. The threshold for Perception tests to detect suppressed firearms as well as silent melee (like knives) and ranged weapons (such as bows) have their threshold increased by 4, typically to 6 assuming no other modifications. This applies to Sensor Tests as well.

        After successfully subduing an opponent, the adept may immediately after subdual perform one of the three options tied to maintaining a grapple freely without spending an additional action. This effect only occurs once per grapple. The target cannot take any actions before Vicious Lunge resolves. If opting to do damage, this damage benefits from Fisher’s Method unless using a garrote.
