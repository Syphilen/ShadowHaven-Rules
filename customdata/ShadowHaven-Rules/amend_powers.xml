      <name>Hot Qi</name>
      <notes>
        Now functions as following: Hot Qi may be used to activate a qi focus to gain ranks in an adept power that exceeds the adeptâ€™s Magic Attribute, but doing so inflicts 1 unresisted Physical Drain. If the power has an innate limit in Rating, it cannot be bypassed.
